# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project segments customers into distinct groups based on behavioral and demographic data using unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering). The goal is to help businesses tailor marketing strategies and product offerings.

## 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📁 Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the input dataset (`customer_data.csv`)
- `notebooks/`: Full step-by-step Jupyter notebook
- `models/`: Saved K-Means model using pickle
- `visuals/`: Elbow method, cluster plots
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## 📊 Methodology
1. Data Cleaning & Normalization
2. Feature Selection
3. Elbow Method to determine optimal `k`
4. K-Means Clustering
5. Cluster Profiling & Interpretation

## 📈 Results
- Identified 4 distinct customer segments
- Created visual insights for each segment
- Helped define target groups for marketing
